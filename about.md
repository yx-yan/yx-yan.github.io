## 👋 Hi, I'm Yuxuanyan.

Welcome to **YXY**, my digital garden on the internet.

I am a lifelong learner passionate about **Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and the art of Prompt Engineering**. This blog serves as a repository for my learning notes, technical explorations, and occasional thoughts on how technology shapes our world.

### 🚀 Why this blog?

I believe in the **Feynman Technique**: *"The best way to learn is to teach."*

By documenting my struggle with code, my understanding of algorithms, and my experiments with LLMs, I hope to solidify my own knowledge and perhaps help others who are on a similar journey.

### 🔍 What I write about

* **AI & LLMs**: Understanding the magic behind the models.
* **Prompt Engineering**: Exploring how to communicate effectively with silicon intelligence.
* **Data Science**: Finding stories hidden within numbers.
* **Web Development**: Building things (like this blog!) from scratch.

### 🛠️ Colophon

This site is built with **Jekyll** and hosted on **GitHub Pages**. The design is heavily inspired by the minimalist aesthetic of [Lil'Log](https://lilianweng.github.io/), featuring a custom academic typography system (Merriweather & Inter) and a reader-friendly dark mode.
